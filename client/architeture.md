# GreenSpaces Application Architeture

## Overview

Greenspaces will enable the public to plant more trees.  The application will match pubilc and private spaces with voluteers to provide and/or plant trees.  This will simplify to process for those who want to increase tree numbers to combat climate change.

While many, exciting scientific advances are occuring at lab scale to remove carbon dioxide (C02) from the air, Trees are still the best natural source of C02 reduction in the air.

Trees will pull C02 out of the air adn store it in their biomass.  Once mature, trees can be harvest and used for good or buried to prevent return of stored carbon to the atmosphere and new trees can take their place.
